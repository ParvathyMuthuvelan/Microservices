Yum is a leading restaurant chain that operates 50+ restaurants across the country. Due to successful business model and solid understanding about consumer needs, the Yum executive management feels that they can increase their business by going online and delivery food to the door steps of the customer.  

They are planning to open an online portal called truYum through which they want to reach out a larger customer base. 

For this Front End Portal, the development team wants to develop a strong middle ware layer exposed as Microservices REST End Points so that the web portal can service its customers accordingly.
